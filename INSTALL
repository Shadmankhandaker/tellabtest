How to set up from a freshly cloned repo:

Now most of the initial set-up can be accomplished
simply run running "make" from the top-level directory.

This does a number of things:

1)  Creates a self-signed certificate by running scripts
in admin_scripts/openssl

2)  Installs npm modules in pageServer and apiServer

3)  Creates javascript constants files (to insure consistency
between the client and the server)

What is NOT done:  linking the "public" directory.

The public directory contains a lot of stuff from the legacy system
that hasn't been fully integrated into the new revision, plus user
uploads...  All stuff that is no longer part of the repo, and needs to
be cleaned up.

# Certificates:
# On the public servers, the certificates are created with certbot
# and letsencrypt, but for development it is simpler to use
# a self-signed certificate; in order for the browser to accept this,
# the root cert must be trusted explicitly...

# Make sure HOSTNAME and PAGE_SERVER_HOST are defined in the environment:
# HOSTNAME is used by installConstants.csh (also installConstants.sh), and
# may be left undefined for default behavior.
# (BUT WHAT IS THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR???)
# On my development system, HOSTNAME is set to nitsuga.jbm.net - which is
# NOT the real hostname, but apparently it doesn't matter because
# it is just used to compare to other possible values in a script
# that determines whether the system is production or development???
#
# PAGE_SERVER_HOST is critical for proper CORS settings.
# On development systems, this should be set to localhost:3010
