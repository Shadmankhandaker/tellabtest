There is a database collection userlog, which logs events, but
the entries don't include timestamps!?  So we can't determine when
a user was last active!?  We should add timestamps to these records
going forward!  TODO


Footer links don't work (terms of use, license, etc.)

************** public subdirectory *********************

In public/experiment_html, we have small html files that generate the frames
between blocks in an IAT run (among other things).  I created a new IAT experiment
a few days ago, and it seems to have created a dozen small duplicate
files, this seems a bit wasteful.

The directory contains over 25,000 files!?
The filenames all consist of 16 hex digits...

public/experiment_images has 447 files.  I looked at the contents of one,
it appeared to be black (junk)...

public/experiment_js doesn't have a lot of files, but among what is there,
there appears to be some duplication...

public/images contains images that are used in the web site. -But not all!

public/img contains stuff that doesn't display properly (using jpsee).
Not sure what these things are for...

public/plugins seems to contain more third-party software...

public/tmp is a place where the server writes temporary files before
downloading...

public/uploads has 596 subdirectories (with unintelligible encrypted names),
the names appear to be encrypted/coded versions of the usernames.  We need to
have a way to map these more easily to users, so that we can delete files
stored by inactive users.
