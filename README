How to start tellab:

First, mongodb must be running...

% node app.js


/***************************************/

Program structure

app.js loads (via 'require') modules, including most
of the files in subdir 'routes'.  These are linked in
by calling app.use with different path components.  Presumably
the path components referenced in the route files are
all tacked onto these prefixes.  These in turn make calls
to res.render, which appear to reference .ejs files
in subdir views.  These contain stuff that looks a lot like
html, but with some extra goodies.
