If a session with an effective user times out, when the user tries to 
refresh the pages and is redirected to the login page, after logging in
the home folder will not be found, because the real user's home folder
is pulled instead of the effective user.  Refreshing the page again shows
the effective user's home, but this needs to be fixed.  Perhaps the effective
user should be cleared on login, as it is on logout?

Furthermore, after logging out of an effective user, and logging back in,
the previous effective user's home page is shown (until a page refresh).
This is probably because the folder id's are stored in the user object?
These need to be cleared/reset on logout/login...


###  Wow, these are really old:

admin display of comments:
	horizontal spacing of elements is bad
	comment text should be wrapped to make table less wide.

on item not found screen, need to add padding on the left...

Posting a comment on an experiment should clear the text box,
and give some sort of indication that the comment has indeed been stored...

On paradigm/xxx screen, filtering experiments works but widgets are
not loaded with contents of URL query string.  Also sort widget is not appearing?
